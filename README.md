# Determining-the-status-of-car-parked-using-ML-on-ESP32-cam-for-smart-parking-application
Our team had worked on creating a ML based application for determining the status of car parked on ESP32 cam. Its made only for one car. We wish to improvise project in future.
We have used Edge impulse platform for uploading the dataset and creating the ML model and used Arduino IDE for deploying the model on ESP32 cam.
